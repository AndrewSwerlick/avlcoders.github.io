# About IRC

Our chat system uses IRC, or "Internet Relay Chat". This is a time-tested method to connect and chat with each other online. You can either configure your own client, or use the links below to access IRC over the web. Stop in, say hello.

# Configuring your IRC Client

If you already have an IRC client, configure it to:

1.&nbsp; Connect to irc.freenode.net

2.&nbsp; Join the channel #avlcoders

Alternatively, you can use this link if your IRC client is configured.
