# Donate

The [Asheville Coders League](http://www.meetup.com/Asheville-Coders-League) on Meetup.com is paid for entirely by [@mindtonic](http://mindtonic.net). The fee is ~$15/month. So far we've been able to avoid member dues through voluntary donation. Your financial help is greatly appreciated. The easiest way to contribute is to donate directly via Paypal:

<form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post" target="_top">
<input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick">
<input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="YTUD3MGFG8QAS">
<input type="image" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donate_LG.gif" border="0" name="submit" alt="PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!">
<img alt="" border="0" src="https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1">
</form>

Alternatively you can bring cash donations to a Meetup and we'll <strike>promptly spend it on pizza</strike> make sure it gets to the right hands.
