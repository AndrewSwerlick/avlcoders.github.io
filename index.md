The Asheville Coders League is a group of coders who
meet regularly on Wednesday nights at the Asheville Brewing Company on
Coxe Ave to share slices and beers.

We also strive to have one technical meetup a month.  Previous
technical meetups include:

* sharing different implementations of Tic Tac Toe
* intro to Clojure
* intro to Vert.x
* intro to Scala

We are a ployglot group, so if it's a programming language someone is
probably using it.

If you are interested in hanging out with us, by all means join the
[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/asheville-coders), join
our [meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/Asheville-Coders-League/), and come out and join us.
